## Code and Dataset
code of Cross-regional oil palm tree counting and detection via multi-level attention domain adaptation network

Detailed tutorials will be available in a later time.  We hope that our work can help other researchers who are interested in domain adaptative tree crown detection.

Our dataset can be downloaded from
